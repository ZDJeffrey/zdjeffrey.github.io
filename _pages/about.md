I am currently a junior student in the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/) at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). I expect to receive my bachelor's degree in 2025 and then pursue a master's degree at Sun Yat-sen University.

My research interest is Machine Learning in High Performance Computing.
